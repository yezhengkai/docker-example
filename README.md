# docker-example
Repository of Dockerfile that I use and create

# Prerequisite
1. [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
2. [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
3. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Some Docker images use GPUs, so nvidia-docker needs to be installed.

Please note that nvidia-docker currently only runs on Linux.

# Docker images
Based on the README files in each directory, create or pull the image and run the container you need.

<mark>Scripts in this directory and subdirectories are for Ubuntu.</mark>
